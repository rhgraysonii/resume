## Experience
### [Ahalogy - Full Stack Engineer, Data Engineer](http://www.ahalogy.com)
December 2014 - February 2015

I built systems ranging from Rails projects to Python API's and server deployment. Primarily
started working on a rails Backend and developing an Ember.js frontend to communicate with
the Rails API, transitioning from Backbone.js Also worked with client service/product support
to ensure the application was functioning as needed for users and getting feedback. 

Later, I shifted from a primarily Ruby/Rails and JS based ecosystem to working on operations falling 
into categories including ops, R&D, API design, scaling, algorithmic optimization, and overall 
planning. Worked on projects that enabled the Data Team as a whole to offer infinitely more to the 
other teams via API’s and other services. Have optimized C and Python scripts, implemented 
Hadoop clusters with mrjob, and setting up continuous integration testing and deployment 
working with another developer. Also planned and developed further products with core overall 
engineering team members.

We later architected and implemented an entire ETL pipeline and API development framework using 
Python, Posgresql, mapreduce, Redshift, and Mesos/Chronos with the data science team to handle 
all API's utilizing this data and ensure constant availability of high-use tables.

## Projects

### [Volt - Contributor](http://www.voltframework.com)
Volt is a reactive web framework that allows all client and server code to be written in Ruby.
It makes isomorphic application development fun and approachable using Opal and a robust backend.
I work on the framework itself, as well as all relevent documentation and tutorials. Currently
we are gearing up for a 1.0 release, and actively finishing the last rounds of development.

### [Volt Tutorial Book](http://www.github.com/rhgraysonii/volt_tutorial)
I am writing a book that encompasses the core functionalities of the Volt framework in a system
that is geared for anyone ranging from beginner to seasoned webdev, and ramps up in a logical
progression. It currently is planned to officially coincide in release with 1.0 in the coming
months.

### [From 0 to Warp Speed](https://medium.com/@_devbob/from­0­to­warp­speed­b780a2bc36ce )
Optimizing linear algebra ops in NumPy to be 1000x faster with BLAS library changes by being 
F­Contiguous over C­Contiguous in interpreting down python code. 

### [Building An OCR Server](https://realpython.com/blog/python/setting-up-a-simple-ocr-server/)
A simple guide that encompasses teaching skills ranging from basic Python and building REST 
API’s, up to *nix core competencies such as using make, working with tarballs, using git, and 
more. Was highlighted as a guest post on the [Real Python Blog](http://www.realpython.com)

### [Clojure: From Zero to Deploy](http://www.penflip.com/rhgraysonii/clojure_from_zero_to_deploy)
Currently writing a book to teach web application development with Clojure. It is built on Penflip, 
letting me collaborate with co­authors using Git­like branching. I am the author of the 
majority of content while the others function as editors and organizers at the current time. 
I have shifted writing concentration towards [Volt](http://www.voltframework.com)

### KBOO FM Mobile
Developed a mobile web app for KBOO FM as an intern. Worked on a team of 6 using agile 
development, test­driven development, and pair programming. Utilized Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, 
and jQuery while testing with RSpec and Capybara. Project has since stopped being maintained by
the repository owners.
